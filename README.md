# Credit-card-fraud-prediction
A credit card fraud detection system that uses machine learning algorithms to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate, featuring data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.


📝 **About the Project**

Credit card fraud is a significant problem for financial institutions. This project uses machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent transactions based on patterns in transaction data.

📊 **Dataset**
Source: Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset Contains anonymized transaction features for European cardholders in September 2013.
Highly imbalanced dataset (fraudulent transactions ~0.17%).

**Features**

Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Handling imbalanced data with SMOTE / under-sampling
Model training with Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.
Model evaluation using Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
Visualization of results

**🛠️ Technologies Used**
Python 3.x
NumPy, Pandas for data manipulation
Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
Scikit-learn for model building and evaluation
Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE) for handling imbalanced data
